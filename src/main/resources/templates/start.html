            <h2>Into to Java</h2>
            <p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,
                and
                specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let
                application
                developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that
                support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
                that
                can
                run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of
                the most
                popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a
                reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which
                has
                since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems'
                Java
                platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities
                than
                either
                of them.</p>

            <h2>Who is the audience of this test</h2>
            <p>The test contains questions most junior Java developers have answers to. The test may also be useful to
                people
                interested in Java or Object Oriented languages from a theoretical point of view. Not all questions are
                purely
                technical - some are related to IT history or OOP practices.</p>

            <h2>Pre-requisites for passing the test</h2>
            <p>It is presumed that the testee is already acknowledged with the basic OOP concepts, definitions of
                method,
                variable,
                loop and has minimal interest in Core Java as whole.</p>
